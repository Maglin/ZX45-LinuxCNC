The story of converting my ZX45 milling maschine to CNC

## About this book {#h.p_I4uTZxSMtosx}

This site is intended to show the whole story of converting my ZX45 miller to a closed-loop CNC milling maschine with LinuxCNC.

There is also a discussion in the german maschinist forum [zerspanungsbude.net \#Thread 26643](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.zerspanungsbude.net%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ff%3D50%26t%3D26643&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFGvv0LAbBxQziMak0SQ12HlAer4w) where I already documented the entire build process.

This site is a writeup of the above thread but focused on just the things I've done, without the discussion around it. Be aware, that therefor this site maybe a bit behind the current status of the forum thread. I'll do my best to keep the site contemporary up to date, but for the newest posts just visit the forum thread.

## About me

I am just someone who loves to do all kinds of mechanical stuff in my little homeshop.

That's my way of relaxing from my dayjob where I work as an Software Architect and sit all the day in the office infront of my computer.

I'm also ...

... happily married, proud twin-father of two boys, motorcycle enthusiast and maybe a bit crazy ;-\)
