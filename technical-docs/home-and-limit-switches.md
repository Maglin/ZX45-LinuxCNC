# Home and Limit Switches

The home and limit switches are inductive proximity sensors, three for each axis:

* Min Limit Switch
* Max Limit Switch
* Home Switch

Each axis has it's own D-SUB 9 connector with wires for these three sensors

## Wiring

### Cable Color Codes

* **Blue: **Ground
* **Brown:** VCC
* **Black:** Signal

### D-Sub Socket for each axis {#h.p_RdlburaLUpGY}

There is a small box for each axis to easily wire the sensors with the connection cable.

**1 - Negative limit switch**

```
VCC-1    ->    Brown
SIG-1    ->    Black
GND-1    ->    Blue
```

**2 - Positive limit switch**

```
VCC-2    ->    Brown
SIG-2    ->    Black
GND-2    ->    Blue
```

**3 - Home switch**

```
VCC-3    ->    Brown
SIG-3    ->    Black
GND-3    ->    Blue
```

**Input**

```
GND        ->  DSUB #1
VCC        ->  DSUB #2
IN_SIG-1   ->  DSUB #3
IN_SIG-2   ->  DSUB #4
IN_SIG-3   ->  DSUB #5
```
